**Shell Invader** is a text-based clone of *Space Invaders* implemented purely in **Bash**.  
It’s both a **learning project** and a **creative twist** — made to explore scripting logic, input handling, and terminal graphics.

> I built this to improve my Bash scripting skills to improve workflow automation on Linux — learning through gaming!

## Why Bash?

I wanted to get comfortable with Bash for:
- Automating development tasks 
- Simplifying project setup and deployment
- Improving overall Linux workflow 

So what better way to learn than by making a **retro-style game** in the terminal?

## Features

- Player movement (left/right controls)
- Shooting projectiles (spacebar)
